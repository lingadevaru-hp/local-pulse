## Core Features:

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Light greys and whites.
- Primary text: Dark grey or black for contrast.
- Accent: Blue (#007AFF), consistent with Apple's UI.
- Use system default fonts (San Francisco for iOS/macOS) for native look and feel.
- Clean and well-spaced layouts. Favor a single-column layout on mobile.
- Use clear, concise labels and descriptions to make navigation intuitive.
- Use minimalistic icons from a consistent set (e.g., Tabler Icons, or native iOS symbols).
- Use subtle, smooth transitions (e.g., slide-in, fade) for page and component transitions.
